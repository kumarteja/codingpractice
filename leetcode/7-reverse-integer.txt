Reverse digits of an integer.

Example1: x = 123, return 321
Example2: x = -123, return -321

Note:
The input is assumed to be a 32-bit signed integer. Your function should return 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

Kumar Logic:

Finding digits and forming a number in reverse order is very easy. Same logic works for negative numbers as well because -12%10 will return -2. To check for the overflow condition form a long integer and check with integer limits

Kumar Code:

class Solution {
public:
    int reverse(int x) {
        long res = 0;
        while(x) {
            res = res*10 + x%10;
            x /= 10;
        }
        return (res<INT_MIN || res>INT_MAX) ? 0 : res;
    }
};
